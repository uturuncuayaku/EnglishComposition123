## Summarizing my semester writing the paper.
I believe my writing has improved significantly due to the overwhelming pressure of trying to get a good grade in the class. I felt especially confident in my ability to choose a goal and work towards it minding the respective feedback and criticism. The entire semester was definitely difficult and felt arduous to delve deep into my difficult topic and I've learned how to generate a valid thesis that could use more artistic flair and prose but ultimately I believe it is deliberate and emotive succinct for my persuasion.

The other way I dealt with the stress and hardship was to read articles and articles of information pointing me so much in one direction that by the time my draft was done. I had a complete blank bank of thoughts about my persuasions oppositional views. The only motive was to find the most boring point and compound it with slight anecdotes that didn't fit well with my paper but clearly demonstrated the reason for lack of research into the area that my essay was involved with at the time. Much less resources about the oppositional view but seeing as how they are generally detrimental socially as well as professionally to the topic. It wasn't heavily emphasized and made my difficult task really cumbersome and awkward. This point is where I should have asked myself for a personal reference to hear from directly but this was also impossible.

I learned researching is great but developing your thesis to back up your main points is super important to not get lost in the overwhelming research found. Maybe next time I will choose a topic I'm not interested in as well, because I felt a tremendous amount of bias in my writing skewed towards my persuasion of course. So, besides being able to delegate my time and find only research from my main evidences, I believe has made me only a bit better of a writer and more wary and cautious of approaching topics close to my heart.

Thank you!
