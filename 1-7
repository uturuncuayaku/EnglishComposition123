	In my major of Computer Science, there are several disciplines and ways to code a computer or systems application and laws governing the accumulation of data. There is algorithmic bias and the development of professional workplace skills as two central issues that I find myself concerned about and relevant to today’s workforce environment. Within these fields, each has a particular characteristic worth exploring as an issue to be discussed and researched using credible facts and logical reasoning for their persuasion. Software Developers need to employ these and a variety of other technical skills acquired in college to be successful, but businesses report the inadequate preparation. (Brookings Institute 2017) Lately research has also demonstrated that soft skills such as positive communication, public speaking, collaborative skills, adaptability, and critical thinking are missing from college graduates. Algorithmic bias in the development of processes meant to make our lives easier and hopefully not contribute to the inequities found in the world today. Businesses need to take a proactive role in disseminating the knowledge and experience of their industry to further the technical and soft skills that enable us to thrive and compete in worldwide markets. 
The first issue connected within the Computer Science major of Software Engineering is the unethical and biased outcomes of artificial intelligence algorithms. Without proper oversight, a company’s data can be manipulated to make harm towards society more severe and vast than ever before in the history of mankind. In politically and socially charged discussions about race in our country it has been noted that data can be manipulated so that the algorithm can give preferential treatment towards white inmates in recidivism cases versus other minorities. Police officers across the nation have been seen eschewing data to manipulate judges for a long time by omission or negligence. This time it is being done at a more widespread level across the country instead of the isolated incidents on the news, to paint a different picture of the reality increasing the unfair likelihood of black inmates getting higher bail sentences or not being released from prisons for the same crime from a different race. 
A counter argument to this issue is one that contains an analyzable amount of bias. Implicit bias from not knowing the circumstances to how our choices and friends make up our decision-making pattern of thought. The circumstances and bias of thought that occur when police officers find themselves in already disparate communities only policing a predominantly black population can be traced to eschewed data, the public refusing to challenge inequitable decisions by companies, and lack of public oversight. These are all arguments to demonstrate how the algorithm has been manipulated from its onset of use. For example, in one use case it decides for the court if it should allow inmates to be released or paroled at a higher bond while being a mysterious avenue of judgment. The police officer’s union is full of good, honest folk with a tendency to be overprotective and due to the nature of their jobs the public believes they have expectations of being involved in conflict daily magnifying the distrust in police officers’ ability to perform well on the job. This bias or argument is the main cause of the distrust in algorithms and generates divisive conflicts between, the majority white police force, and the predominantly black neighborhoods across the country.
The second issue pertaining towards software engineers is the lack of soft skills and the potential skill gap from academic institutions to business campuses and how these soft skills translate to profit for businesses and a direct avenue for personal growth. The counter claim to this is that students or professionals have limited time to learn and acquire skills and this creates tremendous pressure on people to succeed. Software engineering is known as having nerdy types and gifted people with unique talents and these exacerbating differences felt growing up are detrimental to a person’s quality of life. There are companies that perform daily stand-up meetings or rituals to host and provide updates on what work is done. But across social media it has been noted that it is wasting valuable company time. (TikTok, 2022) During, this time it is important for teams to catch up on weekly events or pressing issues. Many productive hours a week is lost, and this is attributed to the skill gap between senior software engineers and their junior counterparts because the juniors may feel like they will seem incompetent. New technology is rapidly advanced through the software ecosystem and maintaining more updates further puts the business behind in their goals. Students don’t learn enough from academic institutions, or it varies wildly between them all to gauge a student’s future success in a company. To successfully implement cohesion there needs to be more academic incentives for companies to give their recent graduates to brush up on their skills. There are numerous websites promoted online that enable students to take advantage of these programs for free, like Leetcode and HackerRank but the lack of incentives through meetings and scope creep remains an issue in the software industry. Balancing both the needs for business growth and personal growth is a difficult process for companies to implement because software engineers do not stay at one job for long. Investing in the future where a skill gap is found within one of every three business becomes crucial for the economic, unified, and social growth of the world. The main audience I hope to reach are current students looking to enter the workforce with the skills necessary to thrive and live healthy productive lives.

Persuasion of a topic in my field of study requires different sources of information that build upon credible evidence, historical trends, the study of implicit bias, and data aggregation methods to be convincing for other researchers and professionals in software engineering the main audience to source and plea for a change in the algorithmic development process. Sociologists, and psychologists are best equipped to understand the importance of the data and illustrates the difficulty of bringing multiple disciplines together for common good. Working for the common good is not always at the forefront of the current business model because of the need to consume data that impacts future business investment. Cost effectiveness has caused businesses to shy away from implementing equitable models, but this hurts the overall economy by limiting minority stake in real estate and small business. How it effects our current lives and what it will take create change is what I’d claim the importance of algorithms in business to promote community health while eliminating bias is my main goal and topic for persuasion. These algorithms are deployed across multiple industries and therefore have far reaching impacts. (USACM, 2017)
